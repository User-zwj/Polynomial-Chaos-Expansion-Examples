# Polynomial-Chaos-Expansion-Examples

Recreate plots in Paper 'THE WIENER–ASKEY POLYNOMIAL CHAOS FOR STOCHASTIC DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS'

I will use several notebooks to demonstrate how to recreate each examples in this paper. The format is '.ipynb'.

Later I will change all the notebooks to '.py' format.

(A test if other people can merge changes without pull request)
